1 - normal distribution:
  - play with densiity curve
  - sample normal distributions adn check sample mean x theoretical mean
  - Repeat sample and check the distribution of means (unbiased distribution)
  - Link to central limit theorem

2 - Law of large numbers with Poisson:
 - Sample from a Poisson, plot a frequency table and compare with theoretical probabilities
 - Increase sample size

3 - TCL with binomial distribution
 - Sample position of each person and check the distribution of many persons
 - Link to glaton board

4 - Simulate data from a linear gaussian model
  - play with different values of sigma
