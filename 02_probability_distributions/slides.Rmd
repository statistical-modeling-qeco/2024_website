## Random variables

.pull-left[

* Many values are possible, even for averages of measurements taken
  exactly in the same way, and under strongly controlled conditions.

* Scientific measurements are **random variables**: quantities that
  are inevitably affected by random events.

* How to deal with that? With models that tell us what's the chance of
observing each possible value of the measurement.

* In other words, by building **probability distributions**.

## 1st step: the density scale

.pull-left[


* Let's re-scale the y-axis of this histogram, to make the total area
  of the histogram equal to one.
* That is, we express the original frequencies (or counts) in a new
  scale, such that the sum of the area of the bars is equal to one. We
  cal this scale **density**
* This is a linear (a.k.a. proportional) re-scaling, so the shape of the
  histogram does not change.

## 2nd step: the density function

.pull-left[

* Now let's imagine how to "smooth" the distribution of densities,
  using a continuous function.
* Think on this function as a continuous counterpart (or a continuous
  limit) of the histogram. This is the **density function**
* The area under the curve of a density function is one.

.pull-left[

* The density function is a continuous mathematical function $f(x)$ that returns a density
  value for any value of the measurement $x$.
* We call the **sample space** ( $\Omega$ ) the set of all values that a
  random variable can assume.

## Density function and probabilities

## Probability distributions as models


* The density function that we have defined is used to express
  probabilities of random variables, or a **probability
  distribution**.

--

* It is a model that attributes probabilities to data, that is, to
  values of a random variable.

--

* In our example, the random variable is the mean thorax length that
  we got from samples of 30 flies.

--

* With this kind of model we can ask many interesting questions about
  these sample means, like:

### What's the theoretical expected value for this distribution?


```{r}
th.m <- mean(dthor.m$th.mean)
p2 +
    geom_vline(xintercept = th.m, col = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1.1) +
    geom_segment(aes(x = th.m + 0.002, xend=1.068, y= 12.5, yend = 15), arrow = arrow()) +
    annotate("label", x = 1.087, y = 15, label = TeX(r"($\int x \cdot f(x) \;  dx)", output = "character"),
             parse = TRUE, size = 7)
```

---

## Which probability distribution ?


* Now we know that probability distributions are a nice choice to
  model random variables. But how to build such a model?

--

* There are recipes to do that, but many probability distributions
  have been already proposed, for a huge variety of data types.

--

* In our example, our random variable are sample means. The **Central
  Limit Theorem** states that sample means will follow a Normal
  distribution, as the size of the samples increase.
  
--

* This is one of the most important results in probability theory. We
  have very good reasons to choose a Normal distribution as our
  statistical model.

## The Normal Distribution

.pull-left[

* Created to describe distribution of additive measurement errors.
* CLT tells us that this is good model for any random variable which is
a sum of many other random variables.
* It is a symmetric distribution, always bell-shaped.
* It has two parameters, that correspond to the mean and standard
  deviation of the distribution.
* Its mean and standard deviation  are independent.

## Model fitting

  given the data observed.

* There are many ways to do that. For one of the fitting methods we will
  use in this course, the estimates for fitting a normal distribution are:
  
  * The sample mean as an estimate for $\mu$
  * The sample standard deviation as an estimate for $\sigma$

## Some notation


* Our model: mean thorax length $x$ follows a normal distribution:

$$ x \, \sim \, \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)$$

--

* The estimate of the parameter $\mu$ is the mean of the values of $x$ in the sample:

$$ \widehat{\mu} \, = \, \bar{x} \, = \, \frac{1}{N} \, \sum_{i=1}^N x_i $$


---


## Some notation



* The estimate of the parameter $\sigma$ is the square root of the variance of the values of $x$ in the sample:

$$ \widehat{\sigma} \, = \, \sqrt{s^2} $$

* Where the variance is the mean of the squared deviation from the sample mean:

$$ s^2 \, = \, \frac{1}{N} \, \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$ 

---

## Other probability distributions

.pull-left[
 
* The normal distribution is widely used, but other distributions
   suit different random variables better. There are many models to choose.
* Choosing a probability distribution to describe a given dataset means
   **making a hypothesis on how your data is generated**.
* For instance, take the number of kids assigned to male gender in 
   families of 12 children in Saxony in the XIX century (Geissller, 1889 *apud* Lindsey, 1995, Introductory Statistics).

## A simple model for this data

.pull-left[

1. Each family is an '*essay*' or an '*experiment*' with 12 '*trials*'; 
2. Each trial (a birth) has only two possible outcomes: male or female gender attributed to the newborn;
3. Trials are independent: the gender of one newborn does not affect the gender for the next births in the family;
4. The probability of each outcome at each trial is constant.
5. These assumptions holds for the **binomial probability distribution**

## The binomial probability distribution

.pull-left[

* Assigns a probability for discrete values (real numbers, like counts):
$$f(x) = {N\choose x} p^x (1 - p)^{N - x}$$
  * $N$ : number of trials in each experiment
  * $p$ : probability of 'success' in each trial
* $N$ is usually known. To fit a binomial distribution we need only to estimate $p$

## Fitting a binomial distribution to data

.pull-left[

* A good estimator of $p$ is the observed proportion of successes
  among all trials. 
* In our example there was 38100 
  children assigned to male gender among a total of 73380 births, 
  or an observed proportion of 0.519 males.
* Red dots show the probabilities assigned by the binomial with this
  estimate, which suggests a gender bias towards males.

## Some other distributions

### Discrete

* **Poisson**: count data of independent events at a constant rate (e.g. number of captures of animals in traps)
* **Negative binomial**: the same, for aggregated events (e.g. number of trees of a given species in forest plots)
* **Geometric**: number of trials before an event with constant rate happens (e.g. number of years of life)


---

## Some other distributions

### Continuous

* **Log-normal**: multiplication of many random variables (e.g. population sizes in birth-death dynamics)
* **Exponential**: continuous time up to an event at constant rate (e.g. failure times of machines, life-spans)
* **Gamma**, **Weibull** : same as exponential, but event rate as a function of time (e.g. life spans with aging)
* **Uniform**: equiprobable values (useful as a null model or to generate other distributions)

## Take-home messages

1. Probability distributions assign
   probabilities to each possible value of a measurement.

--

2. As such, probability distributions can be conceived as models of
   the process that generates the data at hand.

--

3. We fit a statistical model by finding sensible values for the
   parameters of probability distributions.
